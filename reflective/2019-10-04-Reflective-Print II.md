## The subconscious implications of fonts.


When discussing the fonts we researched before coming to class, another classmate mentioned that they had looked at the font [Roseart](https://fontreviewjournal.com/rosart/ "Font Review Journal - Roseart"), and when looking at the font they had felt a sense of adventure and were reminded of older times. I found this interesting, because I had experienced similar feelings on first-impression, which is why I was drawn to it in the first place. A third classmate brought up the idea that we could've been given that impression because of the words that were spelled out in the font, such as "Archeology" and discussions of explorative gameplay. At first I was adamantly opposed to the thought, I was sure that I had evaluated the font without influence from the words, and I still am. However, after thinking longer about why I got that impression from the font, I've come to the conclusion that fonts *do not* have intrinsic evocations or associations. The subconscious implications instead arise from a mixture of social, cultural, and personal experiences. 

Several thoughts and ideas led to this conclusion. The first was when I was looking at the font [Calcula](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/calcula/ "Typographica - Calcula"). I'm a big fan of video games and retro-themed gaming fonts, so when I first saw Calcula I was really excited, because to me the font looked like it came straight out of a vintage gaming manual. Going to read the review of the font, I quickly realized - with some disappointment - how wrong I was. The creator, Shiva Nallaperumal, had designed the font based on inspiration from Kufic Arabic scripts that many "Islamic architects, beginning in Syria and Iraq around the eighth century CE, used to brick or tile the surfaces of their buildings with decorative texts".<sup>[1](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/calcula/ "Typographica - Calcula")</sup> This immediately led me to the realization that geographical and cultural differences can have a huge impact on font interpretation. I never would have looked at Calcula and drawn those conclusions, because my knowledge of Islamic architecture is extremely limited. 

Going back to the Roseart font, I think the reason Roseart gave me a vintage and adventurous impression is because of the associations I've made with similar looking fonts. The images below contain examples of fonts that I find similar to Roseart and each of the fonts were chosen to advertise products or locations with the intention of evoking a vintage or adventurous feeling. I think over the course of our lives we see font styles repeatedly being put to use for specific purposes, which leads us to draw certain associations based upon past experiences and expectations.

In my own research, I came across an article on the man who who designed the Stranger Things font. Seeing the title, I assumed he had designed the font specifically for the TV show, but I found the typeface was actually created back in 1978, and it was chosen for the show because it "screams ’80s" due to "its associations: the covers of Stephen King paperbacks and Choose Your Own Adventure novels, the copyright notice on old VHS tapes, and the covers of old Smiths albums, to name just a few of the cultural artifacts it has been tied to over the years".<sup>[2](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062722/meet-the-man-who-designed-the-iconic-80s-font-in-stranger-things "Meet The Man Who Designed The Iconic Font In “Stranger Things”")</sup> For me, this example in particular reinforced the notion that font implications aren't inherent; how could a font designed back in 1978 "scream 80s" if the 80s haven't yet occurred? It's only the prolific use of the font throughout the 80s that gives it that feeling.
