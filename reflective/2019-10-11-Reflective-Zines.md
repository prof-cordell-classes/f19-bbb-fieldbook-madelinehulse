## The Underground Distribution of Zines and Their Modern Equivalents

Although it's likely that many zine makers in the past, like Pagan Kennedy, started simply out of boredom, a large reason many zines emerged was to support subcultures and marginalized communities, as we discussed in class. Since zines at the time were print-based and more ephemeral, they provided many groups with a safer medium for spreading information. Zines are typically published in smaller numbers than large magazines, which allows publishers to limit the scope of distribution in case the zines contain information that, in an outsiders hands, could possibly cause them harm. The biggest example of zines in underground culture appears to be the Riot Grrrl feminist movement from the early 90s, which was closely involved with punk music and supporting women artists. The zine leading this movement, *Bikini Kill*, was created by four girls in a band with the same name. Their zine focused on "punk rock, politics, feminist issues, and Riot Grrrl, as well as scene reports on local performances and news on bands".<sup>[1](https://www.flavorwire.com/128822/a-brief-visual-history-of-riot-grrrl-zines "A Brief Visual History of Riot Grrrl Zines")</sup>

Another example from the late 80s is the zine *Pansy Beat*, which provides a glimpse into the East Village queer scene in NYC. It was inspired by *My Comrade*, another queer underground zine in New York. The zine featured information about the local community: "gender-bending club boys wearing heavy eyeliner, underground parties, local queer-owned bookstores", and information about the AIDS crisis.<sup>[2](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/wj5wjm/5-boundary-breaking-butt-loving-queer-zines-to-know "'pansy beat' zine captured the 80s east village queer scene")</sup> The zine also came with a free condom in order to promote safe sex, an action influenced by the AIDS epidemic.

Thinking about how zines provided a safe space and support system for different communities to expressed their thoughts, feelings, and interests made me interested in how the medium has transformed in the digital age and what zines are like today. Some zines converted into blogs, or continued producing zines alongside blogs (like the zine [Jigsaw](http://jigsawunderground.blogspot.com/ "Jigsaw"), which made distribution easier. Digital zines also cut production costs and made them free for readers, resulting in an opportunity for wider readership.

Zines have experienced a sort of resurgence in the past few years. [Sweet-Thang Zine](https://www.instagram.com/sweetthangzine/ "Sweet-Thang Zine"), for example, was created by founder Zoe Thompson to provide a creative space for black women. The  [Sassify Zine](https://www.instagram.com/sassifyzine/ "Sassify Zine") was created by Jason Kattenhorn "to connect topics like queerness, gender and identity with their work and discover every aspect of 'sassiness'".<sup>[3](https://indie-mag.com/2017/12/underground-zines-scene/ "HERE’S WHAT THE NORM QUESTIONING ZINE SCENE LOOKS LIKE")</sup> Priya Dadlani, a Boston University grad, recently launched the zine [Spicy](https://spicyzine.com/ "Spicy Zine") to "provide a space for women of color and queer/trans people of color to share their stories".<sup>[4](https://nyulocal.com/what-nycs-zine-culture-means-for-marginalized-writers-cee8c4f632a0 "What NYC’s Zine Culture Means for Marginalized Writers")</sup> The majority of these zines are focused on traditionally marginalized communities who, in the more progressive society we now live in, now have the ability to publish more openly. They utilize social media, such as Instagram, to promote their zines and some have digital blogs or zines while still selling physical copies/editions. 

While these zines are incorporating digital media into their publication, I'm not really sure if their form has technically transformed since the actual zines are still in the same form as they were originally. So, I tried to come up with what I thought digital equivalent of zines. Blogging sites like Tumblr came to mind, but Tumblr is open to the public, so I felt the exclusivity in readership, which I consider an essential part of being a zine, wasn't properly replicated. The concept of finstas on Instagram was one of the closest I could come up with. Finstas are private Instagram accounts that can only be viewed by people you allow to follow it. You can post photos with captions and they're virtually private and most people only allow close friends to follow them. This makes them similar to zines, in my opinion, because they have the same aspects of limited readership, lack of intention for mainstream media reach, and functionality as safe spaces for communities to spread ideas and information. 

Another possibility would be Wordpress websites or any other sort of blog that requires login information to access the website. This makes the content on the website limited to people explicitly given access by the creator. In a way, this seems even more secure than zines, which could be picked up by unintended readers if the physical copies weren't destroyed upon consumption, like when a random guy found Pagan Kennedy's zine in her friend's bathroom. However, anything shared with others always has the possibility of being further distributed, especially in the current digital age.
