# Reading Prep: Print II

## Questions or Observations

1. I found the idea of making regional fonts very interesting, because I think it is possible to capture the unique characteristics of a place and translate them into a distinct typeface. In the same sense, I think you could do the same thing with a person or a country, which really speaks to the ability of typeface to convey additional information without even taking into account the actual text.  

2. I've never seriously considered the implications of choosing a specific font when reading something until I started to look at fonts from a design perspective, which made me really realize how important chosing the typeface you want to use is. They have strong subconscious implications you don't explicitly notice, which I find interesting in the context of writing a book, designing a political campaign, or coming up with a company logo or advertisement. 

3. The section on programmed type was specificly interesting to me because I hadn't ever thought about why the fonts often associated with early computers were so pixelated and or why people used pixelated fonts today for nostalgic or aesthetic purposes, so I was kind-of surprised to learn that it was due to early technological limitations of computers and the low resolution of screens. Early print had similar restrictions with their typefaces as well, so I'm interested to see if new typefaces with emerge as a result of even higher resolution screens becoming available, or if 3D printing or VR will cause some new interactive or multi-dimensional typefaces to be created.
