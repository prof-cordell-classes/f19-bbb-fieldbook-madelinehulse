# Reflective: The Dragon Prayer Book Workshop

## Medieval Text and Anthropodermic Books

During the Dragon Prayer Book Workshop we learned (or at least attempted to learn) how to differentiate between different letterforms so that we could try decoding the text. I found the task extremely difficult. Many of the letters looked incredibly similar (as evidenced in the image below, which spells out 'animal'), the scribes frequently used abbreviations that took out various numbers of letters, and their punctuation was, to me, indistinguishable from some of the letters. They sometimes combined letters together, using the ending half of one letter to additionally function as the beginning half of the next letter, which was incredibly frustrating. When we asked the reason for these shortcuts, they explained to us that, although it was confusing for us, it wouldn't have been confusing to the reader, who would have already known the prayers in the book. Combining the letters also helped save valuable space on the pages.

However, I was still confused as to why many of the letters looked so similar and why some of the lowercase letters looked completely different from the uppercase letters. Some letters, like 'y', are combinations of other letters; in this case, letters 'g' and 'u'. Some letters, like r and s, had different forms based on where the letter came in the sentence. I rather naively assumed it had to do with efficiency and saving space/paper/ink, like the many shortcuts they devised did. When I looked around on Google, I quickly figured out that they were simply mimicking Old Roman cursive, but had made the letter more vertical, which I assume was probably done to save space. So maybe I was right.  

Going off topic of the Dragon Prayer Book specifically, when the archivist was initially showing off the book, one of the students asked about which types of animal skin books were typically made of, which led to the question of whether any books had been made out of human skin. The answer was that there had been; apparently there was a doctor who had "three medical volumes [bound] in the skin of a patient with the first diagnosed case of trichinosis"<sup>[1](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boston-athenaeum-skin-book "Boston Athenaeum Skin Book")</sup>. Naturally, later on I decided to look up these books and was surprised to find that they're actually quite prevalent, and was even more surprised to find that the Boston Athenaeum actually holds such a book. The book is the memoir of criminal James Allen, alias George Walton, who had two copies of the book bound in his own skin upon his death due to tuberculosis. He gave one of the copies to his doctor and another to a man he attempted to rob. Harvard University also has an 1880s copy of Arsène Houssaye’s Des destinées de l’ame (Destinies of the Soul) made from the skin of a French woman. 

The Anthropodermic Book Project has tested 31 of the 50 alleged anthropodermic (bound in human skin) books and confirmed 18 of them to be made from human skin.<sup>[2](https://anthropodermicbooks.org/ "The Anthropodermic Book Project")</sup> I find it extremely interesting that there are this many morbid books in creation, and what could possibly drive people, other than, say, serial killers, to actually make these books. Most seem to involve medical professionals, which I suppose makes some sense but is still very ethically questionable. Three editions of Holbein's 'Dance of Death' are supposedly bound in human skin. The nature of the subject relates to the use of human skin, but still seems unjustifiable. The whole idea of having something made of human skin is definitely macabre and personally I don't think any book could have a justifiable reason for being bound in human skin.
