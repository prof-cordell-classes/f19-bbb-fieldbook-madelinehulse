## The Implications of Public Access to Books

Until reading The Book, I never truly understood just how expensive book production was before the invention of the printing press, and our visit to the Northeastern Archives really drove that home for me. Looking at the small medieval codex, the full impact of the cost finally hit me: the number of cows killed to make parchment, the amount of time scribes spent copying down text, the cost of ink and any added illustrations or illuminations, and the final expense of binding the book. Buying a book was, for some period of time, as expensive as buying a car in modern times, which means books were primarily made for and used by a very small, rich sector of the population for a significant period of time in history. 

Thinking about the exclusivity of books made me wonder about the possible implications of that exclusivity, the most obvious being extremely low levels of literacy in the general population, as well as a lack of general or standardized education, which makes technological, societal, or scientific advancement more difficult. The content of many books was likely inaccurate in a historical sense, hence the phrase "history is written by the victors". Those in power had more control over what books were created and distributed, because they were the few who could afford them. 

The costs attributed to the physical form of books prevented a very large sector of the population from having access to books and the information they contain inside them. As we move on to new forms of the book, I wonder if the situation will repeat itself and if it's possible that new book forms could hold more nuanced information or enchanced experiences that place the general population at a disadvantage compared to the rich. And if so, would that impose a similar burden or inhibition on society as before? 

For example, I'm interested in the potential virtual reality (VR) has to replace books in the future. VR could be used to virtually travel to other countries and experience history, learn about science in a hands-on setting, explore journalism and news in a new fashion, etc. While the same sort of information is available on the internet, VR as a medium has more potential for sensory immersion and providing an all around more valuable/transformative experince. This new form of book has the potential to connect people and enhance their lives in a way that wasn't possible before. Assuming VR has similarly impeding costs as books originally did, I wonder if these possible barriers of purchase for the general public will have any negative impacts on society.
