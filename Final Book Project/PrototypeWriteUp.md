#Project Prototype:

Image uploaded separately because I couldn't figure out how to get it in here.

Outline:

1. Player renders into a forest/mountain scene
2. They're directed to walk to a specific area
3. An animation plays to drop leaves into a pot of water that turns brown
4. The player is directed to drink from the pot
5. The end

The scene will include more trees and foliage. I also plan on adding some ambient sounds that will play through the earphones on the headset. Right now there is a ball player that can be moved around with WASD keys, but soon I'll be implementing control through the controllers. 

List of Assets I found that I will likely be utilizing:

Panda BT - Tree Scripting Engine

Photoscanned Rock

Unity Standard Assets

Mountain Terrain + Rock + Tree

Steam VR Plugin

3D Game Kit
