## Exploring Virtual Reality as a Book

1. *The content of your book. What will it be about?*

	At the moment, the content part of the book is very subject to change, but I was thinking of recreating the story of the discovery of tea. Short Version: Emperor sitting on a hill taking a break on his hike. Some tea leaves drift into a pot of boiling water and it smells good, so he decides to try it out. Something that I personally think might be funny is if you end up drying or the tea has some special effects, since the book would be in VR and you can simulate those sort of things. With this project, I really want to explore the idea of fully immersive books, because I think VR has the potential to replace the codex and e-books in the future.
	
	An alternative idea content-wise (if this would be possible) is working with the NU Archives group to replicate their manuscript into a VR experience that could be shared with other people. I would have to look into the feasibility of doing this, however.  

2. *The format of your book. Will it be printed and bound? A zine? An ebook? A hybrid? Something else?*

	I would like to utilize Virtual Reality as a form of book for my project, ideally incorporating some other media into the project. The project would be developed using Unity and as a member of the NUVR club on campus I have access to the lab and headsets for testing the project. I'd like to incorporate some other media, such as using photography to 3D photoscan real-life objects and textures into a virtual environment. It would also be cool to see if I could get the details of a letterpress print to show up. 

3. *The skills you will need in order to execute your project, as well as a plan for acquiring those skills, particularly if they are not skills we will formally study together. There will be class periods devoted to individual learning that can be used to facilitate such supplemental skill development.*

	The skills needed for this project are very much so not not skills we will study together. I do have prior experience with Unity, and not everything will have to be created from scratch, so from a time standpoint I think it will be feasible. I've already looked through some tutorials on 3D photoscanning and turning photographs into VR textures 

4. *The materials you will need to complete your project, as well as a plan for acquiring these materials.*
	
	Materials for the photographs could be found outside around campus (like trees, grass, leaves, stone textures, flowers, etc.). If I went in the direction of recreating The Dragon Prayerbook, I would just need to take a bunch of pictures of the text (no flash).

5. *The equipment you will need in order to complete your project, as well as a plan for accessing that equipment. Some of this equipment may be readily available through Huskiana Press (attached to our classroom), but even so you should outline a plan for use.*

	I have access to VR equipment for testing and I have my own camera to take any photographs I might need, although in the event that I need a higher resolution camera it might be possible for me to rent one through the library.

6. *The team working on your book. Is this an individual or group project? If the latter, what does each member bring to the group?*

	Individual project. 

7. *A plan for evaluating the project. What are your goals for this book, and how will we know whether and to what extent those goals have been met?*

	I have different goals for each of the two content ideas. For the story about the discovery of tea, I'd like to have people try out the completed project and then fill out a survey to see what they thought about the book. For example, if they understood the story (since there would be no explanation as to what is going to happen) or if the format was too confusing to undertand without any explanatory context. 
	
	For the Dragon Prayerbook, I think it would be interesting to try to recreate a monastery room where nuns would've actually read the book and make the environment into a virtual exhibit of sorts with information on the book, the ability to flip through it, and possibly the ability to translate the portions of the book they have translated. 
	
	I think the project should be evaluated on:
	* Completeness: If I completed the project or finished a significant portion of the project.
	* Complexity/Time: The project should involve a relatively significant amount of work.
	* Ease of Use: I'd like for the project to be easily accessible to anyone with access to a VR headset and user friendly.
	* Ability to draw insights/Comparability: With the narrative content, for example, if I was able to have enough people try it out and get a survey, it would be interesting to measure the comprehensibility of the VR story compared to a text-based version. With the Dragon Prayerbook, I'd like to compare the differences in the experiences looking through the book in-person versus in a Virtual Reality environment.
