# Reading Prep: Print I

## Questions or Observations

1. Until watching the assigned video for this week, I hadn't fully realized just how many technologies had to improved enough to be used in the mass production of books. It now makes more sense to me why it takes hundreds of years for the production of books to completely change. 
2. I thought it was very interesting that Gutenberg had to initially appeal to the church by printing indulgences, otherwise the church potentially had the power to prevent the press from being created/used. It makes me wonder what other technologies were potentially delayed due to interference from the church and if this sort of interference still happens today due to government or other organizations with power. 
3. Why has no one further automated the process of letterpress printing? We've automated the production of many other things that seem much more complicated, and with technologies like 3D printing and more durable materials available, it seems like letterpress printing could be further advanced, but isn't.
