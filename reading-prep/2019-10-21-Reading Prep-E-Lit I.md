## Questions or Observations

1. It seems to me like the majority of the differences discussed in "The Reading Brain in the Digital Age: The Science of Paper versus Screens" between reading on paper vs reading digitally are due to generational differences and older generations not growing up with technology. Even Millennials and Gen Zs like myself won't have grown up knowing and using technology as intuitively as kids growing up today, so I think a lot of the issues they identified has a possibility of being reduced or disappearing. 
2. I think the studies in The Deep Space of Digital Reading help to prove my idea from before. As long as the approach towards reading is with the intention of learning and engaging with the text, it doesn't seem like the fact that the text is digital or on paper makes any significant difference. 
3. *17776 What football will look like in the future* is a great example of a book embracing the possibilities of storytelling through a digital medium. I think the failure of ebooks so far has been in their attempt to replicate the codex instead of embracing the opportunities that being digital provides. Although a reason for this failure so far could be in the continuous lack of digital proficiency in the general population. I think a lot of people would find 17776 difficult to read even today; I know my mom or grandparent, for example, definitely would have been confused. Is the reason the book hasn't fully digitally evolved because of the relative 'newness' of technology?
