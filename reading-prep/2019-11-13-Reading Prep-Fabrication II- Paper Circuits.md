# Reading Prep: Fabrication II: Paper Circuits

## Questions or Observations

1. Carlea Holl-Jensen talked about the possible value in drawing to the reader's attention the awareness of the book as an object. Does doing this actually add to the meaning of the content though? Is it actually enhancing the experience of the book?
2. In regard to the *The Pussycat Said to the Owl*, I do think integrating circuitry into the book was a cool idea. However, I'm not sure if the added circuitry actually enhances or adds to the poem in any way, other than possibly aesthetics. On the other hand, the circuitry in the Multimodal Reading Space definitely seems to augment the original codex in a meaningful way. At what point does form alteration actually begin to matter or add to the traditional codex? 
3. I think the idea of reflective design is very interesting for thinking about the digital future of what would be considered a book. By thinking about the individual parts of a book and where things can be changed, how can we translate those pieces over to our ideas of future book forms?
