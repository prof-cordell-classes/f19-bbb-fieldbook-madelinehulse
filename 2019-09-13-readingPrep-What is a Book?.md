Madeline Hulse - Fieldbook Entry 

1. Many terms used when talking about books have their origins in the methods and materials used to make the first books. As we further digitize our concept of books in the future, will we lose these sorts of terms and, if so, does it matter? 

2. The original methods of producing books (I.e. scrolls, clay tablets, bamboo rolls, etc.) are no longer used as books have technologically advanced, with around two methods of book-making remaining in use at the same time. Is it likely that the physical bookmaking process common today will eventually be completely replaced/discontinued in favor of a new form of book?

3. Weâ€™ve seen a rather large decline in large chain bookstores over the past decade. I almost feel like I see more smaller independent bookstores than I do Books-A-Million or Barnes and Noble now, and I feel like the reason for this is that the idea of the small independent bookstore is as nostalgic as reading a physical book is compared to reading an eBook.
